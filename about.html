    <p>Here are some things you should know about me!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I was born and raised in Charlevoix, Michigan. This is a beautiful,
          small town on Lake Michigan.</li>
        <li> Having lived in Grand Rapids since college, of course I am a
          craft beer enthusiast.</li>
        <li>In college I studied to be a Social Studies and French teacher,
          but ended up working in the field of finance instead. I'm hoping that by
          the end of this bootcamp I'll have the necessary tools to become a
          web developer.</li>
      </ol>
